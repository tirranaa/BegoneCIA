### BegoneCIA 

- Update

# Removed IOS operating systems version restrictions ! (IOS 11 - 14) 

- Block GPS 
- Block WIFI registry share 
- Block Cameras 
- Block Microphones
- Block Audio 
- Block Audio polarity reversal options. 
- Fixed Case switch for disabled blocking when incoming calls by any app 
- Fixed app failed detection for facebook.
- Fixed failed detections for all applications, automatic block if switch was on block mode after call.

# Crash info
- Automatic switch case functions are only for calls from all applications including system apps (Incoming and outgoing).
- Unsupported case scenario: 
- If an app that relies solely on the existence of camera or anything else that is blocked is started, it will crash immediately after it can't detect existing camera or else (example tiktok) that it needs camera to function, to use such applications, before using them, manually disable BegoneCIA using CC switch, then reactivate it after you are done with the app, to protect your privacy from unauthorized access by apps or system services to your visual-audio communication devices and location services including blocked records of locations, to avoid permanently location registries access, use relocate or other spoofer services that change locations and blocks actual registries, because while you have disabled BegoneCAI, you will be open for share the moment BegoneCIA is disabled, for a call or some manual other app use, while that is the case, use defence, with spoofer services by your choice.

- Cellular triangulation is possible by Cell towers, but they can't read your exact GPS or WIFI & Bluetooth registry data, nothing really they are not shared, only triangulate based on sim card ID transmit data to the cell towers in near by. Required data from 3 for proper triangulation for less then 50 meters of range, nothing else, avoiding that requires cellular access tower spoofer services, or penament service id share block. That is not supported. But still, that is done the most easily, by not using cellular connection at all, other options possible will not be shared.
