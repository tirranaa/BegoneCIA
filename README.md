### BegoneCIA 

- Update

# Removed IOS operating systems version restrictions ! (IOS 11 - 14) 

- Block GPS 
- Block WIFI registry share 
- Block Cameras 
- Block Microphones
- Block Audio 
- Block Audio polarity reversal options. 
- Fixed Case switch for disabled blocking when incoming calls by any app 
- Fixed app failed detection for facebook.
- Fixed failed detections for all applications, automatic block if switch was on block mode after call.

# Crash info
- Automatic switch case functions are only for calls from all applications including system apps (Incoming and outgoing).
- Unsupported case scenario: 
- If an app that relies solely on the existence of camera or anything else that is blocked is started, it will crash immediately after it can't detect existing camera or else (example tiktok) that it needs camera to function, to use such applications, before using them, manually disable BegoneCIA using CC switch, then reactivate it after you are done with the app, to protect your privacy from unauthorized access by apps or system services to your communication devices.
